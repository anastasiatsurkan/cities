                The harmonious Café New York, known today as Boscolo Budapest, was built between 1891 and 1895 in an eclectic Italian Renaissance style with Gothic touches: neo-Baroque, Renaissance and Rococo architectural stylistic influences can be recognized there. The most prestigious figures in Budapest’s cultural life, whether artists, writers or publishers, gathered at the New York Café. Once considered the most beautiful café hall in the world, it fell into disrepair after World War II, but since 2006 the new owners of the café have made numerous efforts to regain the old patina and its original splendor, all in a magical atmosphere intoxicated by old flavors and typical dishes.</p></center>
