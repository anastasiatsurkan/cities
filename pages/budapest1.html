        St. Stephen's Basilica is a Roman Catholic basilica in Budapest, Hungary. This is the most important church
        building in Hungary, one of the most significant tourist attractions and the third highest church in Hungary.
        The site of today's basilica was a theater in the 18th century. This theater, named Hetz-Theater, was a place
        where animal fights were hosted. One of the wealthy citizens (János Zitterbarth) of the newly formed district
        built a temporary church there. In the late 1810s, about a thousand people formed the Lipótváros Parish. Then
        they began the fundraising and the believers started to make plans for the future church.</p>
