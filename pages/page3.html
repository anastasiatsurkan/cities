It is Europe's tallest cantilevered observation wheel, and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over three million visitors annually. It has made many appearances in popular culture.

            The structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft). 
            When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel. The London Eye adjoins the western end of Jubilee Gardens (previously the site of the former Dome of Discovery), on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge beside County Hall, in the London Borough of Lambeth.</p></center>
