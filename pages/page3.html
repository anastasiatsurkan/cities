        The London Eye, or the Millennium Wheel, is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River
        Thames in London. It is Europe's tallest cantilevered observation wheel, and the most popular paid tourist
        attraction in the United Kingdom with over three million visitors annually. It has made many appearances in
        popular culture.
        The structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft).
        When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel. The London Eye adjoins the western
        end of Jubilee Gardens (previously the site of the former Dome of Discovery), on the South Bank of the River
        Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge beside County Hall, in the London Borough of Lambeth.
