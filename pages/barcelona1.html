        <p style="color: rgb(174, 133, 103);">Park Güell is the famous city park with the mosaics and the salamander in the district Gràcia of Barcelona and definitely one of the most important attractions in Barcelona Spain in terms of visitor numbers and architecture. Park Güell is a city park with an area of 15 hectares. In 1900, Eusebi Güell, member of a rich and royal family from Barcelona, commissioned Antoni Gaudí to build a luxury residential park on an unused plot of land in the north east of Barcelona. The assignment was simple, only a sixth of the green area on the hill was to be built up with 60 houses. Antoni Gaudí eagerly accepted this commission, as it let him to express his own ideas about architecture inspired by nature. This can be seen in the park in the pergolas growing from the stone, walkways harmoniously integrated into the landscape, and the famous wavy and colourful mosaics. With his designs, Gaudí the architect wanted to emphasise the omnipresence of God in Park Güell. Gaudi wanted to recreate the typical British style of residential neighbourhoods, hence the word 'Park' in Park Güell.</p>
