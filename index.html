            <h2 style="color: rgb(174, 133, 103);">PARIS</h2>

            <p style="color:rgb(174, 133, 103)">Paris is the capital and most populous city of France. Since the 17th
                century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion,
                gastronomy, and science. For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world, who arrive in
                the
                city to educate themselves and to seek inspiration from its vast pool of artistic resources and
                galleries.
                As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the "City of Art". The French Revolution and political
                and
                social change in France had a profound influence on art in the capital. Paris was central to the
                development
                of Romanticism in art, with painters such as Géricault. Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Fauvism,
                Cubism and Art Deco movements all evolved in Paris.</p>
